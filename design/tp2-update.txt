For the second deliverable, I made a user interface for the restaurant
recommendation engine. It uses Tkinter, and has a canvas on the right panel
and a frame on the left panel. The left panel has Tkinter widgets for 
a drop down menu to select restaurants from, and also a slider bar to select
the rating for the restaurant. The right panel has the output text (or is
very close to having it), and will also have the Uber and Google maps API calls
to include those things on the graphic.

I also worked on the geolocation, so the text of the ui and the restaurant
options change depending on the user's location in the world.

I made a training set of restaurants, so that the restaurant recommendtion
can be compared against a set similarity base (so we can judge the accuracy
of the recommendation). 

I worked on using the Google maps API, so now we can download a map from
where the user is to where the recommended restaurant is.
